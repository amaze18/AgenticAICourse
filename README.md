# Agentic AI & Employability – From Foundations to Real-World Systems

This repository accompanies the **Agentic AI** course designed and delivered by **Anupam Purwar**.  
The course focuses on building **job-ready, industry-relevant skills** in modern AI systems—moving beyond chatbots to **autonomous, tool-using, decision-making AI agents**.

The curriculum is aligned with real industry needs, startup ecosystems, and national priorities around AI talent and innovation.

## 🎯 Why Agentic AI?

Traditional AI education often stops at models and theory.  
**Agentic AI** goes further:

- LLMs that **plan, reason, and act**
- AI systems that **use tools, APIs, memory, and external knowledge**
- Architectures used in **real production systems** (not demos)
- Skills directly applicable to **jobs, startups, and research**

This course treats **LLMs as a computational core**, not just text generators.

> **Mental model**  
> - LLM = CPU  
> - Prompt + context = program  
> - Tools = I/O devices  
> - Memory = working & long-term state  
> - Agent loop = operating system for intelligence

## 🇮🇳 POET Framework & Employability Alignment

This course is conceptually aligned with the **POET Framework**, a strategic blueprint for building a sustainable and sovereign AI ecosystem in India.

### What is POET?

**POET** stands for:

- **P – Protect our Indic Data**  
- **O – Opportunities**  
- **E – Employable Youth**  
- **T – Training Infrastructure**

The framework emphasizes that **AI progress is meaningless without skilled people who can build and deploy systems**.

---

### How This Course Supports POET

#### 🛡️ Protect
- Teaches responsible AI system design
- Emphasizes evaluation, risk mitigation, and safe deployment

  - Startups
  - Applied research
  - Domain-specific AI solutions
- Students learn how to convert AI capability into **real economic value**

#### 👩‍💻 Employable (Core Focus)
- Bridges the gap between academia and industry
- Focuses on **skills companies actually hire for**
- Prepares learners for a future where:
  - Pure prompt usage is not enough
  - System builders outperform tool users

#### 🏗️ Training Infrastructure
- Introduces modern AI stacks and workflows
- Prepares learners to work with:
  - Cloud AI systems
  - Scalable agent architectures
  - Tool-based AI pipelines
